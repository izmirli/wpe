# Weekly Python Exercise 2022 B3

B series (B1/B2/B3) are for people with experience. 
Intermediate/advanced level exercises, on a whole bunch of topics.

WPE isn't like most other courses you've seen. It operates as follows:
* Each Tuesday, at 11 a.m. your time (in theory), you'll receive a problem to solve, along with "pytest" tests meant to help you get there.
* On the following Monday, you'll receive the solution, also via e-mail at 11 a.m. in your time zone.
