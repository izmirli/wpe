# WPE 2022 B3 Exercise 11: Enum cards

Create one Enum class called CardSuit, which will have four values (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades) and CardValue,
which will have 13 values (ace through king).

Using these two Enums, you should create a deck of 52 cards (4 suits * 13 values), in which each instance of Card has
both a suit and a value.  Then you'll choose five random cards from the deck, creating a hand (a Python list). When 
printed, the list should look like this: 

    [4 of HEARTS, 2 of SPADES, 11 of DIAMONDS, 6 of DIAMONDS, 2 of DIAMONDS]

If you can get the cards to sort, first by suit and then by value, all the better!
